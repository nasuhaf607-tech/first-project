The trajectory details the transition of an application development from an AI engineer to a new expert. Initially, the project was an empty directory, with the user providing a detailed specification for an OKU Transport Rental System based on a free-stack architecture (MySQL, Appsmith, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap). The user later clarified a preference for React.js (frontend), Node.js (Express) (backend), MySQL (database), and Socket.IO for real-time features, also providing a GitHub repository with an existing PHP/React codebase.

The AI engineer began by analyzing the provided codebase, which was primarily PHP-based with a React frontend, and then adapted the initial plan to the specified Node.js/React/MySQL stack. A significant portion of the interaction involved setting up the development environment, managing dependencies, and rigorously debugging frontend-backend communication issues, including CORS, proxy configuration, and port conflicts. The authentication flow (registration and login) proved particularly challenging, requiring several iterations and architectural adjustments, eventually leading to the React frontend being served by the Express backend. The AI engineer also implemented a basic structure for the application, including user roles, a layout, and initial components for booking and administration. The user then provided an updated, comprehensive list of new features for implementation.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an OKU Transport Rental System from an existing codebase, focusing on a robust, free-stack implementation. The system must support three distinct roles: OKU (passengers), Drivers, and Admin/JKM.
Key workflows include:
1.  **Driver Registration & Activation:** Drivers register, complete profiles (photo, license, vehicle info, accessibility features), and await Admin/JKM approval to become 'ACTIVE'. Drivers do not create bookings.
2.  **OKU Registration & Booking:** OKU users register, complete accessibility profiles (wheelchair, ramp, preferred vehicle). Admins assign drivers to OKUs. OKU users view assigned drivers' availability and request bookings (daily/monthly). The system must enforce business rules: active assignment, active driver status, and no booking overlaps. Booking requests should include location autocomplete (like Grab/Maxim). OKU passengers should be able to select vehicle types based on accessibility needs.
3.  **Driver Ride Management:** Active drivers receive and manage ride requests efficiently through a mobile-friendly interface (accept/reject).
4.  **GPS Tracking & ETA:** Real-time GPS tracking for driver's live location and estimated time of arrival (ETA) updates for both OKU and Driver.
5.  **Admin/JKM Dashboard:** A central dashboard for driver approvals, driver-to-OKU assignments, monthly ratings, claims export, user management, and viewing registration data.
6.  **Booking History:** Store booking history for users and drivers for transparency.
7.  **UI Rules:** Enforce profile completion, consistent header, and prominent logout buttons on all dashboards.
The MySQL schema, including tables for users, profiles, drivers, assignments, bookings, GPS tracking, and ratings, along with a  stored procedure, is a core requirement for database-level rule enforcement.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js, OpenStreetMap, Socket.IO Client
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), Socket.IO Server, JWT for authentication
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB, phpMyAdmin, Stored Procedures
- **Deployment/Runtime**: Supervisor for process management
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application, initially a PHP-based project with a React frontend from a GitHub repository, was transitioned to a Node.js (Express) backend. The React frontend is built and served statically by the Express backend on a single port (8001) to resolve cross-origin issues.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

- :
    - **Summary**: This file evolved from an empty backend to the core Node.js Express application. It handles user authentication (registration, login), serves the React frontend build, sets up API endpoints, and integrates Socket.IO for real-time features. It manages MySQL database connections and implements business logic.
    - **Changes Made**:
        - Replaced PHP backend logic with Node.js/Express.
        - Integrated  for database interaction.
        - Implemented JWT-based authentication endpoints (, ).
        - Added Socket.IO for real-time communication.
        - Configured to serve the  directory (React production build).
        - Added API endpoints for driver profile, booking conflicts, and other features as part of the latest update.
        - Includes extensive error handling and logging.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing a new set of comprehensive features requested by the user, focusing on completing the OKU Transport System. The work initiated includes:

1.  **Driver Profile Completion Flow**: A new React component  has been created. This component is intended to handle the mandatory profile updates for drivers, including document and vehicle information uploads, before they can accept bookings, and to enforce the waiting period for admin approval.
2.  **Enhanced Booking System**: A new React component  has been created. This component is being developed to incorporate advanced booking features, such as location autocomplete (similar to ride-hailing apps), real-time booking conflict detection, and allowing OKU passengers to select specific vehicle types based on accessibility needs.
3.  **Driver Schedule & Booking Conflict System**: The backend file  was modified to include the necessary API endpoints and logic to support driver scheduling and prevent booking conflicts. This involves interacting with the MySQL database to check for overlapping bookings and driver availability.
4.  **Driver Dashboard Component**: A new React component  has been created, likely as a central point for drivers to manage their profiles, view requests, and interact with GPS tracking.
5.  **Application Integration**: The main React application file  has been updated to incorporate these new components and define their routes within the application's navigation flow.
6.  **Database Connection and API Endpoints**: The backend  was modified to ensure correct database connectivity and to create proper API endpoints that support the new features, including driver profile updates, scheduling, and booking logic.

The goal is to ensure all database connections are correct and all necessary API endpoints are functional to support these new features.
